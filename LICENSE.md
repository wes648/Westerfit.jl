 * JH "Wes" Westerfield wrote this software. At the moment it is not ready for
 * public usage. If you really need to use it right now, let me know before you
 * do so.
 * Later I hope to change the license to something to this effect:
 * As long as you retain this notice and cite the paper, you can do whatever
 * you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is 
 * worth it, you can buy me an espresso in return.
 * While you are under no obligation to do so, I encourage you to reach out to
 * me if you are going to be tinkering with the code. Hopefully I'll be able to
 * explain some of the logic of my code and help you add the feature you feel 
 * is missing.
 * Please enjoy, JH Westerfield
