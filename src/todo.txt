This is the great westerfit to-do list.

3 Sept 24
-Automated Suggestor of Distortion terms
--need to learn about contrained optimization

-Performance increases
--higher powers of operators without matrix multiplication
--split by symmetry before diagonalization
---filter array by QN
---generalized block-diagonalizer?

-Multiple Spins
--have some code started
--worried about performance hit
--look into approximations
---this is antithetical to westerfit's objective
--hund's case (a)-like 3 stage diagonalization approach?
---tor, spi-spi, tsr?

-Improved optimizer
--looking into line search for \lambda values
--BFGS & other quasi-newtonian methods?

-Even fold rotor problem
--need to combine A&B torsional states in msgen,etc
--change definition of cosop to accoung for non n*NFOLD values
