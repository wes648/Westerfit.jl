Hello!

Unfortunately this examples folder has become a bit of a mess. Many of them don't work with the current file structure of westerfit. I'd like to fix them someday but in the meantime, PLEASE ONLY TRUST THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES:
2ba (torsion & rotation)
ipfp (rotation & spin)
4cl2ftol (spin, rotation, & torsion)
