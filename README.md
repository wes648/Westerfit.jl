# westerfit
A new program for the simulating and fitting of molecular rotational spectra

The full second order Hamiltonian is coded in.
Goals:
Transitions
-hard coded selection rules based on index have been devised. Comments should be in the code

-just need to implement

Line Intensities

-Currently working to determine closed expressions for the line intensities. 

-Considering using H\"oln London factors instead of proper asymmetric top forms

--easier to code but less accurate. Good idea for a placeholder

Least Squares Fitting Routine

User Definable Parameters

-This one is tricky

-need group theory checker

-Not a priority
